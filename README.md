Hey Ben, 

just wanted to say thank you for the semester so far and hope you're not too sick of looking at index.html files! 

Although I have had some experience with html and css in the past this was by far going to be the biggest project and first responsive website I have done. I think that one of things I did well was my overall process; I started by collecting all the relevant information from various sources. From there I could figure out my page structure and basic architecture I thought would be best for the site.

Once I had done that I tried to make up a quick visual identity, I didn't want to spend too much time on this but deciding on a custom font and basic colour choices just helped to create a consistent design. The design decision around the large headings using this font are to give the site a clean, modern look. A simple black and white theme with lots of white space aims to give the photos of the art plenty of space to breath and shine.

I then took inspiration from the internet to sketch up a few wireframes for my landing page and made them up in figma.

From here I wireframed out some sections and eventually completed my full design of the site.

Having this design really helped with the coding stage because I could focus solely on that and not have to make design decisions within visual code studios. I believe this show a really clear progress from creating to using low-fi prototypes. 

There are a number of things I believe I could have improved on, adding comments while working on the project would have to be the biggest one. I have not included as many comments as I would have liked and adding these at the end meant a less concise description and well it was just a bit of a hassle. A small one, but naming my classes with a _ instead of a - just meant a bit extra time. Once I had started I felt as though I should keep a consistent style. 

There is a small part of javascript within my site, I wasnt planning on using any javascript but I thought it would be the best way to create the desired mobile navigation. Variable 'drplinks' gets the id of the links and using a simple if, else statement toggles them on and off.
